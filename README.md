Lottery

--created by Dustin Chad Parker

/**
 * This program is a simulation
 * of Georgia's Powerball lottery and is to show myself the odds of winning the
 * lottery, since I play the lottery often even though I know I shouldn't.
 *
 * A lottery ticket is generated with numNumbers numbers, each with a range of
 * numberRange, and a PowerBall with a range of powerBallRange. The user 'buys' 
 * numTicketsBought tickets for $2 each within the same parameters. The program 
 * then runs as if the user bought numTicketsBought tickets at one time. 
 * 
 * Lottery then outputs the winnings of each ticket (if any) and the total 
 * amount of winnings after spending numTicketsBought*$2. It used to, and 
 * can easily be changed, to 'buy' a ticket until the user wins, but it was
 * proven to be much less effective than 'buying' multiple tickets.
 * 
 * Moral: Don't play the lottery.
